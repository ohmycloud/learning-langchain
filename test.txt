Core Developments
Daniel Green simplified decoding error reporting function on MoarVM.
Timo Paulssen and Daniel Green fixed several recently introduced decoding issues.
Stefan Seifert properly fixed a long standing NQP issue with register initialization when writing bytecode for repeat loops.
Elizabeth Mattijsen was also busy:
made foo.item (and thus $(foo)) always return a container
allowed here-docs in the REPL
fixed hyper operators and .deepmap producing unexpected types / errors
introduced ordered hashes with Hash::Ordered
fixed a MAIN dispatch issue with named array arguments
In RakuAST developments this week:

Stefan Seifert started working on RakuAST again:
pointy blocks with loop modifiers
quite a lot of (nested) thunk / block related issues
post constraints on non-subset type parameters
exceptions in .ACCEPTS at compile time
fixed implicits such &?ROUTINE in methods
fixed labels on lazy loops
several regex related issues
and many more smaller fixes!
The number of passing test-files with the new Raku grammar are now 142/153 (make test +0) and 1170/1355 (make spectest +12).
